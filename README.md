## What is Siball-Analysis?
Siball-Analysis, SA for short, is a text-based software for recording football stats(soccer if wou will). It is developed in python.  You can find it on the project's [github page](https://mangafas.github.io/siball-analysis/) and the github page's [branch](https://github.com/mangafas/siball-analysis/tree/gh-pages) on github.

## Current Releases and expectations
SA will hopefully be available as a text-based application, a GUI *(Graphical User Interface)* application but also on iOS and Android

### Text Based Application
It's a work in progress having released three official alpha releases 0.3.1, 0.4.1, 0.4.5 and three beta releases 0.5.1, 0.5.9. and 0.6.1. Official Releases will be on github on a every minor change and last patch (major.__minor__.__patch__). Currently we are on 0.6.5. The next version will be 0.6.6. that is not yet developed. Designed and Engineered with **Python** with **subprocess** and **time** libraries

### GUI Application
Haven't started yet but plans ahead for using it with Java. 

### iOS Application
Haven't started yet either and it will be a release only if there is demand. Probably to be written in Swift or Objective-C

### Android Application
Most likely to be developed as there is demand. Havent started yet but and it will be written in Java

## What is Siball-Analysis?
Siball-Analysis, SA for short, is a text-based software for recording football stats(soccer if wou will). It is developed in python.  You can find it on the project's [github page](https://mangafas.github.io/siball-analysis-archive/) and the github page's [branch](https://github.com/mangafas/siball-analysis-archive/tree/gh-pages) on github.

It's a work in progress having released three official alpha releases 0.3.1, 0.4.1, 0.4.5 and four beta releases 0.5.1, 0.5.9, 0.6.1 and 0.6.9 Official Releases will be on github on a every minor change and last patch (major.__minor__.__patch__). Currently we are on 0.7.7. The next version will be 0.7.8. that has not yet developed. Designed and Engineered with **Python** using **subprocess** and **time** libraries

### GUI Application
Haven't started yet but plans ahead for using it with Java.

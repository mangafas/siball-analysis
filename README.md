### Text Based Application
It's a work in progress having released two official releases 0.3.1 and 0.4.1(Current). Official Releases will be on github on a every minor change and last patch (major.__minor__._patch_). Currently we are on 0.4.2. The next version will be 0.4.3 commenting the whole project. Designed and Engineered with **Python**

Haven't started yet but plans ahead for using it with Java. 

### iOS Application
Haven't started yet either and it will be a release only if there is demand. Probably to be written in Swift or C#
